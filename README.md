# Week Three Challenge: Password Generator
# Description:
Employees can use this app to generate an password
based on the specific criteria they select. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated
HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

# Resources and Credits:
Module content and material studied in the virtual class. The code base was developped during the December 2021 Cohort that I belonged to.
Shout out to the partnership with my tutor Corey Yates, during the tutoring session I was able to overcome most obstacles I was facing with the code.
